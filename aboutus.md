description: Yearli is an initiative founded at NITS by a group of students who wished to possess mementos of their friends and college life after they graduate. Noticing that there were no easy solutions in India for graduation yearbooks for colleges and other educational institutions, Yearli was formed with the intention of providing such solutions and to introduce this culture.

					<h3>What is a Yearbook?</h3>
				</header>
				<p>A graduation yearbook is a publication that is produced by a school or university at the end of an academic year to commemorate the graduating class. 
				
				<br/><br/> It typically includes photographs and biographical information about each member of the graduating class, as well as articles about notable events and achievements from the academic year and other memories and highlights from the graduating class's time at college. 
				
				<br/><br/> We've already made one yearbook which you can check out below for more information! </p>
